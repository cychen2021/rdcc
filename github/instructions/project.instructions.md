# RDCC - Reusable Dev Container Components

The idea of RDCC is to provide reusable components for dev containers that can be easily composed to create a specific dev container. The structure of the RDCC is as follows:

- [`src/`](../../src/): The source code for the CLI tool to build and manage RDCC components, and synthesize boilerplate Dockerfiles for specific dev containers according to a given configuration.
- [`components/`](../../components/): Predefined RDCC components.
